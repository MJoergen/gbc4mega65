![Game Boy and Game Boy Color](doc/gb-and-gbc.jpg)

This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Gameboy_MiSTer) Game Boy core which
itself is based on the
[MiST](https://github.com/mist-devel/gameboy) Game Boy core.

[sy2002](http://www.sy2002.de) ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2021.

Special thanks to [Robert Peip](https://github.com/RobertPeip)
for his invaluable support.

The core uses [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
loading the Game Boy's BIOS as well as for the on-screen-menu and for
loading game roms.

Features
--------

* Game Boy and Game Boy Color support
* Super Gameboy Support - Borders, Palettes and Multiplayer (Work-in-Progress)
* Joystick support including special mappings so that you can for example play Super Mario Land via joystock (Work-in-Progress)
* Custom Palette Loading (Work-in-Progress)
* Convenient game cartridge browser which supports long filenames

Installation
------------

1. [Download](bin) the bitstream and the core file for your R2 or R3 machine
   from the [bin](bin) folder.
2. Either use MEGA65's bitstream utility or install the core file so that you
   can use MEGA65's <kbd>No Scroll</kbd> boot menu to load the core.
3. The core needs a FAT32 formatted SD card to load game roms.
4. If you put your ROMs into a folder called `/gbc`, then the core will
   display this folder on startup.
5. The core includes an Open Source Game Boy BIOS. For more authenticity,
   go to https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/bootroms/ and and download
   `dmg_boot.bin` and `cgb_bios.bin` and place both in the `/gbc` folder.
