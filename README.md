**WARNING: Beta version 0.7 - See constraints below**

![Game Boy and Game Boy Color](doc/gb-and-gbc.jpg)

This core is based on the
[MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Gameboy_MiSTer) Game Boy core which
itself is based on the
[MiST](https://github.com/mist-devel/gameboy) Game Boy core.

[sy2002](http://www.sy2002.de) ported the core to the MEGA65 in 2021.

Special thanks to [Robert Peip](https://github.com/RobertPeip)
for his invaluable support.

The core uses [QNICE-FPGA](https://github.com/sy2002/QNICE-FPGA) for
loading the Game Boy's BIOS as well as for the on-screen-menu and for
loading game roms.

Features
--------

* Game Boy and Game Boy Color support
* Super Gameboy Support - Borders, Palettes and Multiplayer (Work-in-Progress)
* Convenient game cartridge browser which supports long filenames
* Joystick support including special mappings so that you can for example play
  Super Mario Land via joystick
* Custom Palette Loading (Work-in-Progress)

Installation
------------

1. [Download](https://github.com/sy2002/gbc4mega65/releases/download/V0.6/bitstream-and-core.zip)
   the ZIP file that contains the bitstream and the core file and unpack it.
2. Choose the right subfolder depending on the type of your MEGA65:
   `R2` or `R3`
3. Either use MEGA65's bitstream utility (`m65 -q yourbitstream.bit`) or
   install the core file so that you can use MEGA65's <kbd>No Scroll</kbd>
   boot menu to load the core. Please have a look at the
   [MEGA65 Starter Guide](https://files.mega65.org/news/MEGA65-Starter-Guide.pdf)
   to learn more.
4. The core needs a FAT32 formatted SD card to load game cartridges (ROMs).
5. If you put your ROMs into a folder called `/gbc`, then the core will
   display this folder on startup.
6. The core includes an Open Source Game Boy BIOS. For more authenticity,
   go to https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/bootroms/ and and download
   `dmg_boot.bin` and `cgb_bios.bin` and place both in the `/gbc` folder.
